## Introduction

The RCPCH Audit Engine / Epilepsy12 documentation site is made with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), which is a framework, separate from Django, which takes Markdown source files from `docs` and compiles them into a static HTML site. These static files are then served from our hosting resources.

## Setting up a Python and Pyenv development environment for the E12 documentation site

Create a virtualenv for the Python modules:

* For info on setting up Pyenv see [Python setup](../developer/api-python.md)
* Any recent Python version works, we tend to use 3.11
* Calling it `mkdocs` will enable Pyenv to automatically select it when you navigate to the directory, because this will match the contents of the `.python-version` file in the root of the project.

```console
pyenv virtualenv 3.11 mkdocs
```

!!! info "MkDocs **Insiders** Edition"

    This project uses Material for MkDocs **Insiders** Edition. To install this, you will need a GitHub token which is available (for RCPCH team only) from Marcus Baw (pacharanero). If you have the token, you can manually run the following command to install Insiders. If you can't access the token, you can install the 'ordinary' (non-Insiders) version, which will be missing a few of the latest features but will almost always still work.

    ```console
    pip install git+https://<INSERT_GH_TOKEN_HERE>@github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The fallback command if you can't access Insiders is: `pip install mkdocs-material`, and if you hit issues then there is more information at <https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/>

Start the MkDocs server:

```console
mkdocs serve
```

MkDocs will tell you what URL you can view the site on, which is usually `localhost:8000`. You can vary this in the settings in `mkdocs.yml`, if port `8000` is already in use.

## `mkdocs serve`

`mkdocs serve` starts up a development server which will auto-reload after changes to the source files, and will serve the documentation on [`localhost:8001`](http://localhost:8001).

To run `mkdocs serve` the fastest way, use

```console
export ENABLE_PDF_EXPORT=0;mkdocs serve
```

If you want the automatic PDF generation to happen in development locally, then run

```console
export ENABLE_PDF_EXPORT=1;mkdocs serve
```

The PDF generation slows down the hot reloading by about 10-15 seconds so it can get tiresome in development. PDF generation will still happen in production when the site is built in a GitHub action.

## How to edit content

* Check out a **new local branch** on which to make the changes, with a **descriptive name**.
* Make changes to the Markdown files in the `docs` folder in the project root.
* Ensure any new or renamed files are listed in the `nav` element within `mkdocs.yml` or they won't show up.
* Save and the changes.
* The auto-reloaded site will show the changes.
* Commit the changes. Try to keep commits tidy and 'atomic' - in that ideally a single commit should be one new or edited piece of content, not a whole raft of changes. This allows us to easily select which commits to include.
* Push the changes and create a pull request to have them included in the main project.

## Deployment

When a push is made to either the `prerelease` or `live` branches, or a pull request is made against `prerelease`, the site is built and deployed to Azure automatically. (Builds are not triggered for PRs against `live` as this branch is often used by RCPCH staff making small PRs to update the documentation, and the build errors due to lack of GitHub access token were causing unnecessary confusion)

* Prerelease URL <https://witty-bush-03ee83f03-prerelease.westeurope.1.azurestaticapps.net>
* Live URL <https://epilepsy12docs.rcpch.tech>
* URLs for PRs against `prerelease` are added to the PR comments automatically by Azure

## Reference guides

MkDocs and Material for MkDocs (the MkDocs theme we are using) have a host of features for making beautiful, practical, functional and easily navigable documentation.

### Markdown

Fundamental to the way the documentation works is the use of a simple set of text annotations called '[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)', which are easily readable and editable as text files but can be compiled into HTML for web viewing. Markdown is hugely popular across the web for rapid entry of web-native formatted text, being the basis of much of GitHub, StackOverflow, and Discourse's functionality.

Markdown uses characters like asterisks (`*`), hashes (`#`) and others, to effect its formatting. For example: `**bold**` to denote **bold** text. It's simple to get used to and, once you're used to it, very productive too. One advantage is that formatted text stays where it's been put, unlike with some word processors in which the GUI formatting tools can have you chansing formatting changes all over a document.

#### Online editing of Markdown

If you are new to Markdown editing, you can use GitHub's interface itself to edit online, by clicking the 'pencil' edit icon in the top right corner of any source code page. There are also external tools like [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) and [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) which give you a nice interface for editing Markdown online, and will sync the changes with GitHub for you.

If Markdown seems daunting then another option is simply to edit the content in the word processor of your choice and then ask one of the RCPCH Incubator team to convert it to Markdown and add it to the documentation.

### Material for MkDocs

On top of the basic features of Markdown, MkDocs and the Material theme adds all the nice website appearance and many additional features for making beautiful documentation sites.

A good overview can be had from looking at the [Material for MkDocs Reference section](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/) and from copying existing code in the documentation that does what you need.

### MkDocs

If you can't find functionality documented in the Material for MkDocs theme website, this is usually because it is functionality which comes from MkDocs, the underlying framework, itself. See the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#writing-with-markdown) site for these features.

### Pymdownx extensions

Some of the features such as [Keys](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/extensions/python-markdown-extensions/#keys) come from extensions like [Pymdownx](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/arithmatex/)
